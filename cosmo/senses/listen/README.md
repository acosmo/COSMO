### Support the project by purchasing my book [COSMO](https://cosmo.yes.app). All proceeds will be donated to charity and individuals in need, like my dad. It is an audio book — a captivating and original puzzle book inspired by my dad. It's unlike any other book you've listened before, blending mystery and emotion with a unique structure that keeps you guessing until the fascinating and unexpected ending.
