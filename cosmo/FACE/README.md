COSMO Face

While looking at my old iPhone sitting in the drawer, I thought, this could be a COSMO face.
I turned to my son and asked, “Would you want COSMO to have its own face?”...

Recent studies show that people often prefer a digital face over a physical one. A screen-based face is easy to build, customize, and update. I can create any combination of eyes, smiles, gestures, and templates — and even let the face grow and age over time alongside the robot. Plus, I can display technical information, like debug data, right on the screen.

And so, my old iPhone XS became the perfect candidate for COSMO’s new face.

### Support the project by purchasing my book [COSMO](https://cosmo.yes.app) All proceeds will be donated to charity and individuals in need, like my dad. It is an audio book — a captivating and original puzzle book inspired by my dad. It's unlike any other book you've listened before, blending mystery and emotion with a unique structure that keeps you guessing until the fascinating and unexpected ending.
